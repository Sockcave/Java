# Intro to Object Oriented Programming

### Java uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a programming style that is intended to make thinking about programming closer to thinking about the real world.

### In OOP, each object is an independent unit with a unique identity, just as objects in the real world are.

### Objects also have characteristics, which are used to describe them.

### An apple is an object; so is a mug. Each has its unique identity. It's possible to have two mugs that look identical, but they are still separate, unique objects.

#### For example, a car can be red or blue, a mug can be full or empty, and so on. These characteristics are also called attributes. An attribute describes the current state of an object.

#### In the real world, each object behaves in its own way. The car moves, the phone rings, and so on The same applies to objects: behavior is specific to the object's type.

#### In summary, in object oriented programming, each object has three dimensions: identity, attributes, and behavior.
#### Attributes describe the object's current state, and what the object is capable of doing is demonstrated through the object's behavior.
